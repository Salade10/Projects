# MOCK CLIENTS

Here you can find all the mock client cases I've done. A mock Client case is where I make up a Client and their needs then aim to solve the problem and make a report about what I have done.

# Example
Mr Dupont wants to buy a £1 million villa in monaco for renting out. This will include:
<h2>Client Brief</h2>
- who the client is
- the clients objective
- investment horizon, risk level, income goal
