# Property analysis
I decided on the Average nightly rate based on this data:

Property Type | Number of bedrooms | Features                                          | Nightly rate | Notes

Mean Pricing  | \----              | \----                                             | 3,328        | \----             

 I used airbnb and looked for villas similar to villa solara and took thir nightly rate then took the mean. Notably,
 There are not a lot of Villas for rent in monaco or on listing sites meaning the market is fairly open.

If the clients income goal sits at €100,000 they need an occupancy rate of: 
€100,000 / 3750 = 27

Note this would not provide the client with a net of €100,000 but more realistically €0-€40,000

I reccomend a target occupancy of at least 60 nights a year for a clean €100,000 net profit:<br>
### assmuing a mid-range scenario
costs of villa = €100,000 per year

income (€100,000) + costs (€100,000) = gross income (€200,000)

nights needed = gross income (€200,000) / €3,750 = 54 nights

dependant on the fluctuating costs the client should range between 43 and 67 nights per year to achieve his target net income.
