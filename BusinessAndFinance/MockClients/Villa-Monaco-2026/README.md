# Client Brief
Mr Dupont, 36, seeks to purchase a €10 million villa in Monaco.
He will use the property for rental purposes and aims to generate
an annual income of €100,000. The investment horizon is indefinite at
this moment in time as he plans to hold the property for as long as it generates income.

# Executive summary
Based on the analysis, Mr Dupont should consider purchasing this property due to the rental market
and the appreciation. The lack of rental villas on the current market makes Villa Solara profitable
and a highly sought after property. This would also allow Mr Dupont to increase prices as he sees fit.


# Market overview
Monaco's Rental market is up +8 to +15% this means that Villa Solara's occupancy
target is likely to be hit especially when considering the occupancy percentage needed is 14.79%
and the current occupancy rate is 50% (according to Airbnb).
This increases the chance that Mr Duponts property will achieve strong occupancy and
competitive returns. 


However, according to the YoY report from Airbnb the revenue change is down -21% from last year. This reflects
market normalisation and increased mid-range supply rather than a drop in demand for luxury villas. Occupancy remains strong at around 50% and the scarcity of high end villas such as Mr Dupont's supports premium pricing.

Monaco has a 1.1% appreciation rate this means  Mr Dupont’s property would gain roughly €110,000 in value every year.
This allows for financial security during bad rental seasons.

 I used Airbnb and looked for villas similar to villa solara, and took the nightly rate then took the mean and the median, however, there is not a lot of market data due to the low rental villa market in monaco meaning the market is fairly open.
 I also recommend a nightly rate higher than the mean due to the high maintainance costs of the villa and due to the fact villa solara offers more than the other properties in the dataset due to it being a previously private villa. The reccommended nightly rate is still realistic due to the current market.
 
Taking maintainance costs into account I recommend a target occupancy of at least 54 nights a year for a target €100,000 net profit:<br>
### assuming a mid-range scenario
costs of villa = €100,000 per year

income (€100,000) + costs (€100,000) = gross income (€200,000)

nights needed = gross income (€200,000) / €3,750 = 54 nights (14.79%)

 dependent on the fluctuating costs Mr Dupont should would need between 43 and 60 nights per year to achieve his target net income.
