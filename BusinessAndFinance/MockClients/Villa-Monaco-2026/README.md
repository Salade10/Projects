# Client Brief
Mr Dupont, 36, seeks to purchase a €10 million villa in Monaco.
He will use the property for rental purposes and aims to generate
an annual income of €100,000. The investment horizon is indefinite at
this moment in time as he plans to hold the property for as long as it generates income.

# Executive summary
Based on the analysis, Mr Dupont should consider purchasing this property due to the rental market
and the appreciation. The lack of rental villas on the current market makes Villa Solara profitable
and a highly sought after property. This would also allow Mr Dupont to increase prices as he sees fit.


# Market overview
Monaco's Rental market is up +8 to +15% this means that Villa Solara's occupancy
target is likely to be hit especially when considering the occupancy percentage needed is 14.79%
and the current occupancy rate is 50% (according to Airbnb).
This increases the chance that Mr Duponts property will achieve strong occupancy and
competitive returns. 


However, according to the YoY report from Airbnb the revenue change is down -21% from last year. This reflects
market normalisation and increased mid-range supply rather than a drop in demand for luxury villas. Occupancy remains strong at around 50% and the scarcity of high end villas such as Mr Dupont's supports premium pricing.

Monaco has a 1.1% appreciation rate this means  Mr Dupont’s property would gain roughly €110,000 in value every year.
This allows for financial security during bad rental seasons.

# Property analysis
I decided on the Average nightly rate based on this data:

Location         |Property Type  | Number of bedrooms | Features                                         | Nightly rate           |           
-----------------|-------------  | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------| -----------------------| 
 Monaco          | Villa         | 5                  | Sea view, wifi                                   | €1 113                 | 
 Monaco          | Villa         | 5                  | Sea view,wifi, multi-story car park              | €892                   |   
 Cap d'Ali       | Villa         | 2                  | Wifi, swimming pool                              | €985 (40% increase)    |
 Cap d'Ali       | Villa         | 3                  | Wifi, seaview, free onsite parking               | €1 013 (40% increase)  |
Mean Pricing     | \----         | \----              |                                                  | €1 000,75              |              
Median Pricing   | \----         | \----              |                                                  | €999                   |


 The properties are from Airbnb and are similar to villa solara, the nightly rate was then taken and the mean and the median were calculated, however, there is not a lot of market data due to the low rental villa market in monaco meaning the market is fairly open and will increase the success of Mr Dupont's property. This is also why we used villa data from surrounding regions such as Cap d'Ali.
Mr Dupont should charge a nightly rate higher than both the mean and median due to the high maintainance costs of the villa and its 1 320² total land which is rare in Monaco. Villa solara also has 5 bedrooms which is not commonly found for rental villas in Monaco, a pool, a sea view and WiFi. Furthermore, Villa solara is a luxury property and premium clinets will pay a lot for the privacy and views the property offers. The reccommended nightly rate is still realistic due to the current market and Villa solara's worth the €3,750 nightly rate positions Villa Solara within Monaco’s luxury tier, where scarcity and privacy command a significant premium over standard Airbnb listings.
 
Taking maintainance costs into account a target occupancy of at least 54 nights a year is recommended to achieve €100,000 net profit:<br>
### assuming a mid risk scenario
costs of villa maintenance = €100,000 per year
occupancy = 30%-50%

income (€100 000) + costs (€100 000) = gross income (€200 000)

nights needed = gross income (€200 000) / €3 750 = 54 nights (14.79%)

Even in a mid risk scenario Mr Dupont is well within safe occupancy rates and should not be concerned.

### assuming a high risk scenario
costs of villa maintenance = €200,000 per year
occupancy = 0%-20%

income (€100 000) + costs (€200 000) = gross income (€300 000)

nights needed = gross income (300 000) / €3 750 = 80 nights (21.9%)

In a high risk scenario Mr Dupont would have an occupancy rate lower than what it would need to be to achive his inscome goal.
In this case is is recommened Mr Dupont tries to rent long-stay as well as short-term so that there is always someone in the property.
If Mr Dupont is having trouble finding clients he should reach out to relocation agencies, corporate housing firms and film production companies. 
It is also strongly advised that he reach out to a profesional accredited financial consulting firm who speacialises in luxury real estate so that he loses as little money as possible.
Mr Dupont should also keep only as many staff as he needs to reduce maintenance costs and try to prevent huge money loss.

Even in a mid risk scenario Mr Dupont is well within safe occupancy rates and should not be concerned.
In a high risk scenario Mr Dupont's property will not reach the €100 000 without strategic financial adjustmesnts. This will not however stop the property from appreciating and the risk is mageable with diversification of rental channels.
